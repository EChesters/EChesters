    	<p>Leading on from Wednesday’s Sowing the Seed talk on imposter syndrome, I thought I would write about my own personal experiences of being an imposter. Karen Pudner talked about how to build your confidence as a developer; as a student coming into industry or when you’re just losing your mojo. During the talk I think it reached out to most of us, and realising there was a name for it made it even more comforting.</p>

<p>During the event, when I was explaining why I had been asked to speak at the event, I remembered all of the times I had been advised against my career choice and that I shouldn’t be here. Whilst my college was filling out application forms for universities and finally deciding on a course, a guy in my class told me, “I wouldn’t do that, if I was you” when I answered Computer Science. What makes me laugh looking back at this, is that he chose the same degree after already failing college once before, including his Computing ALevel. Yet his words echoed every so often, whenever those moments of doubt came about.</p>

<p>Last night, we were shown quotes from Alicia Lui’s blog, about overcoming imposter syndrome. One in particular really hit home;</p>

<blockquote><p><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> …And surely the nail in the coffin was that I had not watched a single episode of Star Trek."</p></blockquote>

<p>Looking back at first year I was talking with a friend, and Patrick Stewart came up in conversation. After admitting I didn’t have a clue who he was, my friend then proceeded to tell everyone the upsetting news that I didn’t know who he was. One guy perked up over the computer screens and gasped in disbelief.</p>

<blockquote><p><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> If you don’t know who Patrick Stewart is, you shouldn’t even be on this course!"</p></blockquote>

<p>There is was again, but at least this time I knew why I was being told I shouldn’t be here. Even last night at the event someone made me feel like a last minute resort due to speaker cancellations.</p>

<blockquote><p><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> Oh are you here as a last minute speaker, are you?"</p></blockquote>

<p>Despite my picture and my biography being published in the event newsletter, in the same newsletter they had been a part of and received there was still a sense of doubt from someone who didn’t know me. Oh did I mention this came from a female tutor?</p>

<p>Reading more about these imposter feelings, lead me to discover that this is more common amongst graduate students and academics. I realised this as soon as I started to look at my presentation for Sowing the Seed compared with the other speakers. I had created a whole of 5 slides, cramming everything I knew or had been involved in, in the last 2 years. Then I realised exactly what I was doing. I love my job, and I can talk about it for hours, days and weeks and at times it doesn’t even feel like a job. But since applying for ThoughtWorks and being given feedback that I didn’t fit the company because I wasn’t passionate, brought back every moment where I felt like an imposter. Someone had finally caught me out. So instead I seeked even more opportunities and from these I made my own. The Manchester Java Community, Manchester’s Android Community, StemNET Volunteering, Code Club, Manchester Girl Geeks, Wikipedia meetups, workshops for MMU’s Computing Society, Manchester Geek Nights and the countless books. I know even without imposter syndrome I would do all of these things and more within a heartbeat, but they still feel like my safety net. So when someone tells me I shouldn’t be doing my degree or if I don’t come across as passionate I have all of these “amazing” things that I have done to say “Noooo, but look! Look at all of this stuff that I do, I’m amazing! No imposter here!”</p>

<p>But despite all of these feelings, I’ve almost made it. I was offered an internship with TW after working with them at Hack Manchester. It’s still mixed feelings. Sometimes I feel like someone will find out sooner or later, since everyone at somewhere like TW seems to live, breathe, eat, sleep and poop development and yet I like dancing and Jiu Jitsu too. But then I look and I have two TW t-shirts to choose from, and despite feeling like this I’ve half made it already. If someone as big as ThoughtWorks can see whatever it is they see, and a tutor personally asks for me to speak at their event because I am an inspiration, then I must be doing something right.</p>

<p>It’s the reason I’m still here, and it’s the reason great people like Karen Pudner and Alicia Liu are still here.</p>
