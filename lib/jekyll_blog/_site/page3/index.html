    	    <p class="post-description">Since a computer has never passed the Turing test, youâ€™d think it was easy to tell if a bot was using your site and not a user. Yet fake Twitter accounts still exist and spam reigns our Tumblr comments. How many loopholes do we have to pass onto legit users before we lose them?</p>

    	    <p class="post-description">It seems like security and user experience are always in tension. Logging into my bank seems fraught with nothing but pain points, frustration and curiosity. Why is it one or the other when it comes to security and user experience?</p>

    	    <p class="post-description">A lot of accessibility is thought to be just about disability, but the way in which everyone accesses your software and information is a whole spectrum. Here I'm discussing how mobility plays into how people are accessing software and some considerations we should take throughout development and testing.</p>

    	    <p class="post-description">Alongside my UX workshop I created a cheat sheet explaining just what UX is. As there's no agreed upon definition, this is purely my opinions! But here I explain the who, what, why and how of user experience aspects such as personas, empathy mapping, prototyping and much more.</p>

    	    <p class="post-description">Despite the technology we have today accessibility is still an issue and still a non-functional requirement that you have to sell to your stakeholders and clients. This post is a take on why that shouldn't be the case.</p>

    	    <p class="post-description">No one questions those who are "gobby" about what they are passionate about. By putting yourself out there it's a lot easier to refer to 'X', 'Y' and 'Z' in those moments where you feel like you don't know as much as you magically should.</p>
