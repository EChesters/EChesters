    	    <p class="post-description">Since a computer has never passed the Turing test, youâ€™d think it was easy to tell if a bot was using your site and not a user. Yet fake Twitter accounts still exist and spam reigns our Tumblr comments. How many loopholes do we have to pass onto legit users before we lose them?</p>

    	    <p class="post-description">A lot of accessibility is thought to be just about disability, but the way in which everyone accesses your software and information is a whole spectrum. Here I'm discussing how mobility plays into how people are accessing software and some considerations we should take throughout development and testing.</p>

    	    <p class="post-description">Despite the technology we have today accessibility is still an issue and still a non-functional requirement that you have to sell to your stakeholders and clients. This post is a take on why that shouldn't be the case.</p>

    	    <p class="post-description">No one questions those who are "gobby" about what they are passionate about. By putting yourself out there it's a lot easier to refer to 'X', 'Y' and 'Z' in those moments where you feel like you don't know as much as you magically should.</p>
