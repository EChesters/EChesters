    	<h2>Personas</h2>

<p>A persona is a role or character that we use to base our application around. They are
scenarios based on user research of those that our application is targeted towards.</p>

<h3>Why do we use personas?</h3>

<p>We create personas in order to grasp the mindset of the possible people who are using
our app.</p>

<h3>How do we represent personas?</h3>

<p>There are a number of ways to represent personas. The ideal situation would be to go
out and ask real people and use them for your pictures. Other ways include stock photos
from Google, cartoons or even dolls. However the downside of the last 4 is that they lack
empathy or even being taken seriously within your team.</p>

<h3>Benefits of using personas</h3>

<ol>
<li>Helps identify opportunities and product gaps between the market and your app.</li>
<li>Gives a focus to projects - understand what people actually want.</li>
<li>Helps build empathy between your team and users.</li>
<li>Provides a reference tool throughout the project cycle.</li>
</ol>


<h4>Example of a persona template</h4>

<p>Templates can change depending on your needs. Include/Exclude any info you need to.</p>

<h2>User Journeys</h2>

<p>A user journey is a series of steps (typically 4-12) which represent a scenario in
which a user might interact with the thing you are designing.
They are used either:
1. To demonstrate the way users <em>currently​</em> use your application/website.
2. To demonstrate the way users <em>could</em>​​ use your application/website.
It depends on what stage into creating your application you’re at.</p>

<h3>Benefits of doing user journeys</h3>

<ol>
<li>Visualise the vision for the project - what will be achieved by this project.</li>
<li>Makes you think at a higher level about what’s involved when achieving a
goal. You can see all of the steps a user is taking - which might be too many.</li>
<li>Helps you understand user behaviour.</li>
<li>Increases understanding of your interface and how it helps/hinders users.</li>
<li>Using analytics it highlights where users are going wrong in your current
system.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Prototypes</h2>

<p>A prototype is a draft version of an application you’re wanting to build. There are
numerous ways of doing prototypes and many variants in what is classed as a prototype.
Each of them have different levels of detail and are used for different things.
Sketches, working models, representational model and video or photo demonstration
are to mention a few. There are so many ways to categorise prototyping but (in my
opinion) we’ll just divide these between Hi-Fi and Lo-Fi prototyping.</p>

<h3>Hi-Fi and Lo-Fi</h3>

<p>These simply stand for High-Fidelity and Low-Fidelity. This just corresponds with the level
of detail that you want to include in your prototyping. Something like a sketch is classed
as Lo-Fi, whereas something like a working model is considered Hi-Fi. Lo-Fi prototypes
are often used to present suggestions, rather than test out ideas like a Hi-Fi prototype.</p>

<h3>Benefits of prototyping</h3>

<ol>
<li>It’s cheaper to create prototypes and make changes rather than start the whole
product from scratch.</li>
<li>Highlights any errors or assumptions early on during user testing.</li>
<li>Quicker feedback from users with the more detail you have leads to better
suggestions and real-life behaviour of how someone will use your app.</li>
<li>Offers a visual of what the app will look like and provides common ground
between teams - designers, developers and business.</li>
</ol>

<h2>User Testing</h2>

<p>User testing is a method of assessing the usability of an application. It’s used to observe a
user’s behaviour in how they use an application or a process they execute where you
want your app to fit in.</p>

<p><em>Rule #1:</em> ​Observe what your users do more than what they say they do. Users are better
at telling you what they don’t want, rather than what they do want.*</p>

<p><em>*Please note:</em> There are numerous rule #1's in UX.</p>

<p>For example, that 50% of survey respondents claim they would buy more from
e-commerce sites that offer 3D product views. Does this mean you should rush to
implement 3D on your site? No. It means that 3D sounds cool. People simply guess or
rationalise how they might act or which features they'll like; it doesn't mean they'll
actually use or like them in real life.

<h3>Benefits of user testing</h3>

<ol>
<li>An application is useless or not usable unless users say they want the idea and
can use the application, so user testing highlights the pitfalls and advantages of
the app.</li>
<li>Saves on redesign efforts and development when errors are caught earlier on.</li>
<li>It makes you develop for someone else rather than yourself which leads to a
better user experience.</li>
<li>Testing with a range of users including those with different ages, cultural
backgrounds and disabilities increases usability for everyone and creates a diverse
product. (Although always keep your target audience in mind)</li>
</ol>

<p>Be prepared with questionnaires to get what you need from a user, and often film the
session.</p>
