    	<p>Welcome to my blog and portfolio. A showcase of my work as a developer, a ThoughtWorks intern and a STEMNet volunteer.</p>

<p>I’m a 21 year old student, studying Computer Science in Manchester. My passion started late, when I was choosing between IT and Computing for an ALevel. When I first wrote my Hello World program in Java, I still don’t understand how I had so many errors. But when it ran, when the compiler stopped complaining and my program finally worked, that was it. I was hooked. It was like the monitor had a holy glow around it and it’s been like that ever since. Any time something, after hours of hard work, research, failed attempts and “ridiculous” errors, finally runs, it’s always felt like it’s paid off.</p>

<p>Of course no one was quick to mention testing or documentation.</p>

<p>My reason for this blog is to share my adventures as a developer. From the struggles of learning something new, to discoveries of human stupidity through bad usability.</p>
